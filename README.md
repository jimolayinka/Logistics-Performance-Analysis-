### Dataset
Qubyteflow logistics dataset


### Tools used
- Excel for Cleaning 
- PowerBI for analysis 


### Discriptige/Exploratory Data Analysis 
1. How many total shipments were processed within the reporting period, and what is the trend compared to previous periods?
2. How many different logistics carriers are currently being utilized, and how does the carrier distribution affect efficiency and cost?
3. What is the average delivery time across all shipments, and which carrier contributes most to delivery delays or efficiencies?
4. What is the most frequent delivery duration, and how does it compare with the average and expected delivery benchmark?
5. What is the total cost incurred for all shipments, and which carriers or shipment types contribute most to the exoenses?
6. How much of the total logistics cost is attributed to fuel, and what patterns or routes influence fuel consumption the most?
7. How has the shipment cost changed over time, and what internal or external factors influenced spikes or reductions in cost?
8. Which carriers cover the longest distances, and is there a correlation between distance, delivery time, and cost
9. Which carriers are most frequently used, and what drives their preference—cost, reliability, availability, or performance?
10.Shipments ComplaintsWhat percentage of shipments resulted in customer complaints, and which carriers or routes are linked to these complaints?
11. What is the average delivery duration for each carrier, and how do they compare in terms of speed and consistenc
12. How many shipments were delayed versus delivered on time, and what are the underlying causes for the delays?


### Data Analysis 
- Cleaned with excel
- Dashboard Report with PowerBI


### Findings

1. Shipment Volume
- Total Shipments: 5,000
- Most Used Carrier: FedEx (2,000 shipments – 40%)
- Least Used Carrier: Amazon (200 shipments – 4%)

2. Carrier Distribution & Delivery Time
- Total Carriers Used: 7
- Average Delivery Time: 3 days
- Mode (Most Frequent) Delivery Time: 6 days
- Fastest Carrier: FedEx (1.5 days)
-Slowest Carrier: USPS (6.2 days)

3. Cost Management
- Total Shipment Cost: ₦2.6 Million
- Fuel Cost: ₦246,000 (Approx. 9.46% of total shipment cost)
- Cost Trend: Highest in early periods (₦900K+), then declines significantly

4. Distance and Carrier Performance
- Longest Distance Covered: FedEx
- Carrier with Moderate Usage but Higher Delivery Time: USPS, Amazon
5. Complaints and Customer Satisfaction
- Complaints: 4.84% of shipments (approx. 240 out of 5,000)
- Complaint-free Shipments: 95.16% – indicates overall strong performance, but still room for improvement

6. Shipment Delays
- Delayed Shipments: 45.2% (2,261 shipments)
- On-Time Deliveries: 54.78% (2,739 shipments)

### Recommendations 

1. Optimize Carrier Allocation
- Prioritize FedEx and UPS for time-sensitive deliveries, as they demonstrate lower delivery durations.
- Reduce reliance on USPS and Amazon for urgent shipments due to their longer delivery timelines.

2. Address High Delay Rate
- With 45.2% delayed shipments, initiate an audit on delivery routes and last-mile operations.
- Implement tracking alerts and predictive delivery systems to preempt and communicate delays.

3. Cost Reduction Strategy
- Explore opportunities to renegotiate contracts with high-cost carriers.
- Invest in route optimization software to reduce fuel and time costs, especially for frequent lanes.

4. Complaint Analysis and Service Improvement
- Conduct a root cause analysis of the 4.84% complaints to identify trends by carrier or region.
- Provide additional training or support to carriers with higher complaint ratios.

5. Fuel Efficiency Monitoring
- Since fuel costs represent a significant portion of logistics expenditure, consider using eco-routing tools and fuel-efficient vehicles.
- Promote alternative delivery modes (e.g., consolidated shipments) to reduce trip frequency.

6. Performance Dashboard Review
- Continuously monitor delivery times and complaint rates per carrier.
- Add filters for regions, shipment types, or weight class to get deeper insights for future decisions.
