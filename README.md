- Reduce reliance on USPS and Amazon for urgent shipments due to their longer delivery timelines.

2. Address High Delay Rate
- With 45.2% delayed shipments, initiate an audit on delivery routes and last-mile operations.
- Implement tracking alerts and predictive delivery systems to preempt and communicate delays.

3. Cost Reduction Strategy
- Explore opportunities to renegotiate contracts with high-cost carriers.
- Invest in route optimization software to reduce fuel and time costs, especially for frequent lanes.

4. Complaint Analysis and Service Improvement
- Conduct a root cause analysis of the 4.84% complaints to identify trends by carrier or region.
- Provide additional training or support to carriers with higher complaint ratios.

5. Fuel Efficiency Monitoring
- Since fuel costs represent a significant portion of logistics expenditure, consider using eco-routing tools and fuel-efficient vehicles.
- Promote alternative delivery modes (e.g., consolidated shipments) to reduce trip frequency.

6. Performance Dashboard Review
- Continuously monitor delivery times and complaint rates per carrier.
- Add filters for regions, shipment types, or weight class to get deeper insights for future decisions.
